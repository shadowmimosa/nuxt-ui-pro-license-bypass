### Instructions
1. Install Docker on your system.
2. Build the bypass image:

    ```
    docker build https://github.com/qweme32/nuxt-ui-pro-license-bypass.git#main -t nuxt-pro-ui-bypass
    ```
3. In your Nuxt project, create a `.env` file with the following content:

    ```
    # Production license for @nuxt/ui-pro, get one at https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/purchase
    NUXT_UI_PRO_LICENSE=XD_BYPASSED
    ```
4. Run the bypass:

    ```
    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/node_modules:/node_modules" nuxt-pro-ui-bypass
    ```
